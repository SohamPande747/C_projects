Basic Level:

Declare an integer array named numbers with 5 elements.
Initialize the array numbers with the values 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.
Print the third element of the array numbers.
Calculate and print the sum of all elements in the array numbers.
Create a loop to print all elements of the array numbers on separate lines.
Intermediate Level:

Write a function to find the maximum element in an integer array.
Write a function to find the minimum element in an integer array.
Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, write a function to check if they are equal (i.e., have the same elements in the same order).
Given an integer array, write a function to reverse its elements in place.
Write a function to remove all occurrences of a specific element from an integer array, preserving the order of the remaining elements.
Advanced Level:

Given an unsorted integer array, write a function to find the two elements that appear only once, while all other elements appear twice.
Implement a function to perform matrix multiplication for two-dimensional arrays.
Write a function to find the kth smallest element in an integer array.
Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subarray (subsequence where elements are in strictly increasing order).
Implement an algorithm to rotate a two-dimensional array (matrix) 90 degrees clockwise.
Expert Level:

Write a function to perform a binary search on a sorted integer array and return the index of the target element.
Given an array of integers, rearrange the array such that all even elements appear before all odd elements, and maintain the relative order of even and odd numbers.
Implement a function to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum (Kadane's algorithm) in an array of integers.
Given an array of integers, find three elements whose sum is closest to a given target value.
